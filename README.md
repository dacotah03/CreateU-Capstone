# Project Title

## Overview

CreateU is An app for content creators that aims to not only simplify their analytics but also give the user an insight on A succesful posting formula that can help build their brand

### Problem

Something I've noticed from being A content creator is that often new creators dont understand their analytics or even what theyre for, analytics are important for brand growth and many creators would be able to grow their pages more effeciently if they had access to A version of their analytics that they could understand

### User Profile

Content creators, ideally to account for that the user would be able to either create an account using their preferred sociial platforms login.
