### Data

If i can, the data i would need would come from the users social pages after they log in with them. I would be able to use that data and adjust the more complicated words into eaasier to understand ones to help break down their purpose for the user. If not the data entered by the user to create their account would help my program pick their niche out of 5 possible options and using that niche i would have preprogrammed suggestions based off whats trending for those niches

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

I'm still trying to figure this portion out, the goal is to be able to log in to the users social media accounts which require auth, but im not sure if the social platforms would allow access to the data requested

## Roadmap

Sprint 1: The Skeleton & Design of the Site
Sprint 2: Adding functionality seeing what works and pivotting on what doesnt
Sprint 3: Testing and Debugging
